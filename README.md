# Morrowind The Inflation

An economy rebalance mod for Morrowind. The mod changes the prices when buying items, spells, and also repair, travel, and training services according to the player's net worth. The higher the player's net worth - the more the services cost.

The mod aims to keep the feeling you have at the beginning of the game: I need to save some drakes to buy that. When you get some Daedric equipment that is completely untrue because of its value. The mod changes the prices of various things the player pays for to the NPCs, which should keep the feeling from the beginning of the game even for high-level characters. A completely new approach to economy-adjusting mods!

## Usage

You can obtain the mod on its [Nexusmods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50580).
